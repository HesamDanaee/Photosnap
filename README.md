# Photosnap

## My Solution
This is my solution for Photosnap challenge project in front-end mentor.
although I changed something like images and some small styles but ***main design***
is adopted from the source.


## What I learned

### Tailwind
I used tailwind for the first time. tailwind is easy to use with a great documentation.
for builidng websites I really prefer using tailwind over other frameworks.
it has comprehensive and standard predefined design system which accelerates the process of developing which saves
you plenty of time but you also enjoy designing.

### React Router
I read [this](https://ui.dev/react-router-tutorial) complete guide to use react router.
